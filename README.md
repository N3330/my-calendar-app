## Description
I was tasked with creating a daily planner to create a schedule. When the app is opened the current day and date is listed at the top of the page. When you scroll down you will see time blocks for the day and each time block is color coded indicating whether its in the past, present or future. When the time blocks are clicked you can type your event inside. When you click the save button for that time block then the text will be saved to local storage which means if the page is refreshed the even will remain saved.
